Welcome to the Magikcraft Magik Users Guide.

Here is probably the simplest spell you can write in Magikcraft:

```javascript
const magik = magikcraft.io

magik.dixit('Hello World!')
```
Type this spell in your spellbook at [play.magikcraft.io](https://play.magikcraft.io), give it a name at the top - `hw` - then click the Save button.

Now go to Minecraft, and type: `/cast hw`.

Magik!

Once you get this to work, move on to [the next step](./02-PARAMETERS).
