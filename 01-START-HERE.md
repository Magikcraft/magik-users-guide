Welcome to the Magikcraft Magik Users Guide.

Here is the simplest spell you can write in Magikcraft:

```javascript
const magik = magikcraft.io

magik.dixit('Hello World!')
```

Type this spell in your spellbook at [play.magikcraft.io](https://play.magikcraft.io), give it a name at the top - `hw` - then click the Save button. This is the name you will use to cast your spell in Minecraft.

Connect to the Magikcraft Minecraft server at magikcraft.io using the Minecraft client on your PC or Mac.

Now, in Minecraft, type: `/cast hw`.

Magik!

*const* is a special magical word for things that don't change. It is short for _constant_.

Once you get this to work, move on to [the next step](./02-PARAMETERS).
