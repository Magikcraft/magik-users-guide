# Leaping

Superman was said to be able to [leap tall buildings in a single bound](https://kerrycue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/superkids-1.jpg?w=1168&h=1318).

Now you can too!

There is a special piece of magik written by the wizard Sitapati that can do it. It is called `magik.exsultus`.

You can use it in a spell like this:

```javascript
const magik = magikcraft.io

function main() {
  magik.exsultus(35)
}
```

Try that out.

`magik.exsultus` takes as its parameter a number between 1 and 100. It's the percentage of maximum power.

Try it with different numbers, or write a version of the spell that takes a number as a parameter and passes it in to `magik.exsultus`.

When you've done that, I'll show you how `magik.exsultus` works.
